This is a school project I made in 2024 for my second-semester project in Computer Science III Advanced Honors. 

The basis of this project is recreating the basic features of the game Minecraft. This expanded on the 3D rendering project I made for my first semester project. However, instead of copying my code, I completely rewrote it so that I could focus on catering towards efficiency for this particular project (I also eliminated a major graphical bug in the process). Noteably, I was still limited by native Java libraries. Furthermore, I added smoother movement, texture rendering, and the collisions that I did not have enough time to add to my first project. 

Besides those improvements, I added numerous novel features (such as ray-casting for block breaking and placement) to imitate the game Minecraft.

To run the sample scene I created, run the GraphicsRunner.java file. To edit the scene, change objects in the Simulation.java file. 

WASD are movement, SHIFT is crouch, SPACE is jump, double-tapping W is sprint, and the number keys are selecting blocks. Camera movement is controlled by the mouse and blocks can be placed and broken with the right and left mouse buttons, respectively.
