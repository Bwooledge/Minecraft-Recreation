This is a school project I made in 2024 for my second-semester project in Computer Science III Advanced Honors. 

The basis of this project is recreating the basic features of the game Minecraft. This expanded on the 3D rendering of my Physics Simulator project, but instead of copying my code, I rewrote it to be more efficient while eliminating bugs. I was still limited by native Java libraries, but it is far less noticeable. Furthermore, I added smoother movement, texture rendering, and the collisions that I did not have enough time to add to my Physics Simulator. 

Besides those improvements, I added numerous novel features to imitate the game Minecraft.

To run the sample scene I created, run the GraphicsRunner.java file. To edit the scene, change objects in the Simulation.java file. 

Movement inputs are WASD, SHIFT is crouch, SPACE is jump, double-tapping W is sprint, and the number keys are selecting blocks. Camera movement is controlled by the mouse and blocks can be placed and broken with the right and left mouse buttons, respectively.
