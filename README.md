This is a school project I made in 2024 for my second-semester project in Computer Science III Advanced Honors. 

The basis of this project is recreating the basic features of the game Minecraft. This expanded on the 3D rendering in my Physics Simulator project, but instead of copying my code, I rewrote it to be more efficient and have fewer bugs. I was still limited by native Java libraries, but I worked around that limitation. Furthermore, I added smoother movement, texture rendering, and ray tracing for object creation and destruction. 

Besides those improvements, everything in this project was coded from scratch to capture the features of the game Minecraft.

Movement inputs are WASD, SHIFT is crouch, SPACE is jump, and double-tapping W is sprint. Camera movement is controlled by the mouse and blocks can be placed and broken with the right and left mouse buttons, respectively.
